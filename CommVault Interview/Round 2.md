So moving on to Round 2 , It was a coding challenge we were given 4 Questions i was able so solve 2 problems compelete with all test cases running and 1 question with 2 test cases running.

The questions were not very hard but the time limit was less. They gave us 65 mins to solve 4 problems.
The problems were based on Graphs, Greedy Approach, Linked List, Dynamic Programming.
### Greedy Problem:
It was a very popular Fractional Knapsack problem . You can find it on GeeksForGeeks. Link to the Problem:- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fractional-knapsack-problem/

### Reverse Linked List in K group:
You can find the problem by going to this link:- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-list-in-groups-of-given-size/

### Dynamic Programming
The question was similar to StarCase problem where you can go 1 step aur 2 steps at a time , and you have to tell how many steps will you take to reach the destination.
So the question was:-
There is a frog and infront of him there is a lake of N length want to cross the lake, but he can only jump atmost M meters at a time. There are N-1 stones in the lake on which the frog can jump, these stones are at 1 meter distance . You have to tell the Number of Possible ways for the frog to reach the other side of the lake.

### There was a question related to graph which i didn't read because of the time limit.
