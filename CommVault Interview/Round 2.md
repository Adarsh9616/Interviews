So moving on to Round 2 , It was a coding challenge we were given 4 Questions i was able so solve 2 problems compelete with all test cases running and 1 question with 2 test cases running.

The questions were not very hard but the time limit was less. They gave us 65 mins to solve 4 problems.
The problems were based on Graphs, Greedy Approach, Linked List, Dynamic Programming.
### Greedy Problem:
It was a very popular Fractional Knapsack problem . You can find it on GeeksForGeeks. Link to the Problem:- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fractional-knapsack-problem/

### Reverse Linked List in K group:
You can find the problem by going to this link:- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-list-in-groups-of-given-size/

### Dynamic Programming
