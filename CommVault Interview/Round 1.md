So Round 1 starts after the prescreening process is done.

Almost all the students from all the campus of SRM made their way to this round.

So CommVault gave us a choice of SDE or SDET. I opted for SDE because i am interested in only Software Development and didnt want to do anything related to testing.

The first round started with Aptitude and questions related to the Programming langauge that you have opted for(In my case it was Java, The options that were available were C++/JAVA for SDE and for SDET we had JAVA/C++/Python).

This round was taken on an online platform that hosted the test and we were monitered using our webcams.
Aptitude questions were basic and logical . In Java section the questions were a bit tricky and most of them were related to the concepts of OOPS.
45 minutes were given for the whole test with a total of 25 questions.
