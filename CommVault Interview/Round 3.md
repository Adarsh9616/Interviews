So round 3 was a Long Coding Challenge. I had no clue what they were going to ask in this round. I tried searching online and after reading all the stuff all i could think of was I cant do it.
All the questions that i found looked like they will ask us to code a file system or something related to Linux.
But in reality it was a complete different experience. I really liked this round. This round sure did test my Object oriented programming skills 
And logical ability to store data into a self designed Data Structure.

This round started at 8:40am . We were briefly introduced about what we were going to do. There were 26 students that were selected for this round , we were divided into groups of three but the task was to be performed independently.
