I think this was the round that almost made me cry.
I was so disheartened after this round, it felt like everything i have been doing for past two months means nothing.

So this round was of 2hours . Yes you heard it right , there were 2 interviewers and i must say they were brilliant. I was so surprised that after working for so long in a company they remember each and every small concept of almost all of CSE core subjects.

So as the interview started they asked me to introduce myself. 
Then they asked me about my projects.
I told them that i prefer JAVA over other langauges .

So the asked me these questions:=>

1=> What is a JAVA compiler and how does Java run a code. 

2=> Name of JAVA compiler - Java in time compiler(I didnt have a clue at that time).

3=> How does Java supports OOPS & What are OOPS principles.

4=> How many types of Polymorphism are there?

5=> Give real life example of Runtime Polymorphism?

6=> How does Runtime polymorphism different from static polymorphism?

7=> Real life use of Inheritance?

8=> What is faster Java or C? and Why?

9=> Why do you code in Java and not C++?

10=> What frameworks have i worked on?

11=> Implementaion of HashMap in Java?

12=> Why do we use just Map while in the left half of Map<Integer,Integer> m=new HashMap<>(); and why i have not used HashMap instead of Map?

13=> Difference between Iterators and Enumerators.

14=> DBMS ACID properties.

15=> Normalisation and its types?

16=> What is DeadLock?

17=> Difference between Process and a Thread?

18=> How will the memory consumption vary in these cases , there is a Process containing 1 thread and there is a Process containing 0 thread?

19=> What are annotations? What do they do?

20=> What are Semaphores?

21=> What are Scheduling Algorithms?

22=> What are directed and undirected graphs?

23=> Can a undirected Graph be a Tree? If yes what are the necessary conditions?

24=> Difference between Structure and a Union in C?

25=> Why do we use Unions? Give real life example where a Union is suitable for use?

26=> How is multi threading achieved in Java?

27=> How to make sure that two running threads using same function do not collide and results in an unwanted output?


## DSA(3 Questions):=>
1=> There is a sorted array that is rotated . You have to find if the element is present in the array and return its index. If not present return 0. This operation should be done in LogN time.

2=> There is an array of integers, You have to find the length of longest subarray that contains consecutive integers. Return the length on the longest Subarray. This should be done in O(N) time.

3=> Given an array of integers . You have to create a new array of same size that will contain value of the next Greater element with minimum difference at each position of array. for eg:

Question=> 2 5 3 1 5 8 34 23 2
Answer  => 3 8 8 2 8 23 -1 -1 -1
