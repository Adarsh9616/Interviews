I think this was the round that made me almost cry.
I was so disheartened after this round, it felt like everything i have been doing for past two months means nothing.

So this round was of 2hours . Yes you heard it right , there were 2 interviewers and i must say they were brilliant. I was so surprised that after working for so long in a company they remember each and every small concept of almost all of CSE core subjects.

So as the interview started they asked me to introduce myself. 
Then they asked me about my projects.
I told them that i prefer JAVA over other langauges .

1=> So they asked me about JAVA compiler and how does Java run a code. 

2=> Asked me the Name of JAVA compiler - Java in time compiler(I didnt have a clue at that time).

3=> They futher asked me about Java and OOPS Principle.

4=> How many types of Polymorphism are there?

5=> Give real life example of Runtime Polymorphism?
