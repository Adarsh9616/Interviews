This was the Funniest Interview Ever.
The interviewer asked me about my introduction.
Then he asked me whether 87 is a prime number or not.
I replied No its divisible by 3.
Then he asked whether 187 is a prime number or not.
I replied No its divisible by 11 and 17.
Then he asked whether 437 is prime or not.
I replied No again and told him that it is divisible by 19.
Then he asked me square of 19
I told him 361.
Then he said do you have any questions for me, I thought he was kidding.
 But that really was the end of this interview.
